# Cursor Rules for School Data Hub Flutter Project

Please think out loud and provide 
- Overview of completed work
- Rationale for decision
- next steps checklist

## Context Usage Guidelines

### Default Context Sources
- **ALWAYS** check `cursor_docs/` folder first when answering questions about:
  - Package usage patterns (watch_it, get_it, serverpod, etc.)
  - Package-specific best practices and conventions
  - API documentation for packages used in this project
  - How packages are integrated in this specific codebase

### How to Use cursor_docs
- When a question involves a package that has documentation in `cursor_docs/`, search and reference that documentation
- Explicitly cite the specific file when using information from `cursor_docs/` (e.g., "According to `cursor_docs/watch_it_readme.md`...")
- Prefer information from `cursor_docs/` over general package documentation when available, as these files contain project-specific context

### Context Priority Order
1. Project codebase (`lib/`, etc.) - actual implementation patterns
2. `cursor_docs/` folder - project-specific package documentation
3. General package documentation (pub.dev, GitHub) - fallback if not in cursor_docs

### Available cursor_docs Files
- `cursor_docs/watch_it_readme.md` - watch_it package documentation and usage patterns
- `cursor_docs/get_it.md` - get_it package documentation and usage patterns
  
## Dart and flutter rules

- Don't use print() statements!!! Implement or use instead final _log = Logger(<ClassName>);
- Always prefer using watch functions over ListenableBuilder
- always use package import even for our project files
  - Comply to the always_use_package_imports rule
- prefer composability breaking down presentation files:
  - creating/ using a "widgets" folder in the page/widget folder
  - creating the broken-down widget in a new file in the widgets folder
- important: don't create model classes without asking! Reason and request it before you do it!
- Prefer using a WatchingWidget creating listenables with the createOnce function over stateful widgets!

## Project Overview
This is a Flutter application for School Data Hub with Serverpod backend integration. The project uses modern Flutter development practices and follows a feature-based architecture.

## Architecture Guidelines

### Project Structure
- `lib/features/` - Feature-based modules with their own models, views, and controllers
- `lib/core/` - Core utilities, constants, and shared functionality
- `lib/common/` - Common widgets and utilities used across features
- `lib/app_utils/` - Application-level utilities and helpers
- `lib/l10n/` - Localization files
- every feature contains `data`, `domain` and `presentation` folders.

### Code Organization
- Use feature-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- 
- Follow the repository pattern for data access
- Implement proper state management using the watch_it package
- Use dependency injection for service management

### Handling DateTime values
- The server works with utc format. Every datetime landing in the server should be in utc format.
- The managers must work with utc format too because there objects are created and updated.
- The presentation layer must be responsible for the conversion .toLocal().
- Managers receiving DateTime objects from the presentation layer must convert them to utc before manipulating / creating objects.
- This is valid for every manager, common or feature
- This has high priority and you are allowed to tackle this if it comes you across.

- include context from the packages where relevant from the `cursor_docs`folder in the file with the package name.

## Coding Standards

### Dart/Flutter Best Practices
- Use `const` constructors where possible
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Follow Flutter's style guide

### Watch_it Best Practices
- **NEVER use watch methods conditionally** - this is bad practice and can cause issues with the reactive system
- Always call watch methods at the top level of the build method, not inside conditional statements
- Use proper null checks and default values instead of conditional watching
- Example of bad practice: `if (condition) watchPropertyValue(...)`
- Example of good practice: `final value = watchPropertyValue(...) ?? defaultValue`

### State Management
- Use `watch_it` for dependency injection
- Avoid listenable builders
- Implement proper state management patterns
- Avoid global state when possible
- Use `ChangeNotifier` or similar for reactive UI updates

### Error Handling
- Always handle async operations with proper error handling
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log errors appropriately using the `logging` package
- Implement retry mechanisms for network operations

### Performance
- Use `ListView.builder` for large lists
- Implement proper image caching with `flutter_cache_manager`
- Avoid unnecessary widget rebuilds
- Use `const` widgets where possible

### Security
- Never hardcode sensitive information
- Use `flutter_secure_storage` for sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication flows

### Testing
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Use `flutter_test` for widget testing
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Maintain good test coverage

### Localization
- Use `flutter_localizations` for internationalization
- Store all strings in localization files
- Support RTL languages if needed
- Use `intl` package for date/number formatting

## Development Workflow
1. Follow feature-based development
2. Use proper branching strategy
3. Write tests for new features
4. Update documentation when adding new packages
5. Run `flutter analyze` before committing
6. Use `build_runner` for code generation

## Common Commands
- `flutter pub get` - Install dependencies
- `flutter packages pub run build_runner build` - Generate code
- `flutter analyze` - Run static analysis
- `flutter test` - Run tests
- `flutter build` - Build for target platform
