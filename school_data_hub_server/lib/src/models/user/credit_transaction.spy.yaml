## Transaction model
class: CreditTransaction
table: credit_transaction
fields:
  ## Sender of the transaction will either be a staff member
  ## or the system itself
  ## Receiver could be a pupil or a staff member
  ## That is why there are no relationships defined here
  ## In case of a pupil, it will be the internalId
  ## In case of a staff member, it will be the userInfoId
  ## We create indexes for both fields to speed up the queries
